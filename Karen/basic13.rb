# Print odd numbers between 1-255
# Write a program (sets of instructions) that would print all the odd numbers from 1 to 255.
puts (1..255).select(&:odd?)

# Print Sum
# Write a program that would print the numbers from 0 to 255 but this time, it would also print the sum of the numbers that have been printed so far. For example, your output should be something like this:
# New number: 0 Sum: 0
# New number: 1 Sum: 1
# New Number: 2 Sum: 3
# New number: 3 Sum: 6
# New Number: 255 Sum: ___.
# Do NOT use an array to do this exercise.

# Iterating through an array
# Given an array X, say [1,3,5,7,9,13], write a program that would iterate through each member of the array
# and print each value on the screen.  Being able to loop through each member of the array is extremely important.
X = [1,3,5,7,9,13]
puts X
X.each { |n| puts n }

# Find Max
# Write a program (sets of instructions) that takes any array and prints the maximum value in the array.

# or even a mix of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero.

new_array = [-3, -5, -7, 5, 0, -2, 3]

# Get Average
# Write a program that takes an array, and prints the AVERAGE of the values in the array.
# For example for an array [2, 10, 3], your program should print an average of 5.
# Again, make sure you come up with a simple base case and write instructions to solve that base case first,
# then test your instructions for other complicated cases. You can use a count function with this assignment.

# whose value is greater than a given value y.

# (since there are two values in the array that are greater than 3).

x = [1, 5, 10, -2]

# Eliminate Negative Numbers
# Given any array x, say [1, 5, 10, -2], create an algorithm that replaces any negative number with the value of 0.
# When the program is done, x should have no negative values, say [1, 5, 10, 0].
x = [1, 5, 10, -2]

# x.each { |x| x>0 ? (puts x) : (puts 0) }

# Max, Min, and Average

# the minimum value in the array, and the average of the values in the array.

# Shifting the values in the array
# Given any array x, say [1, 5, 10, 7, -2], create an algorithm that shifts each number by one to the front.
# For example, when the program is done, an x of [1, 5, 10, 7, -2] should become [5, 10, 7, -2, 0].

# Number to string
# Write a program that takes an array of numbers and replaces any negative number with the string 'Dojo'.
# For example if array x is initially [-1, -3, 2],
# after your program is done that array should be['Dojo', 'Dojo', 2].
